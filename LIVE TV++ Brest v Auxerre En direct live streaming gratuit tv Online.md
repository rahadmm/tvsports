Analysis of the Brest Auxerre match
The stakes of the Brest Auxerre match
Brest wants to get closer to the European places while Auxerre wants to stay away from the relegation places. No advantage in terms of motivation
The state of form
Stade Brestois are back in the Championship, three days after their bitter defeat against PSG in the first leg of the Champions League play-off (0-3). In the national tables, the Finistériens are coming off two good performances. Last week, they qualified for the quarter-finals of the Coupe de France against Troyes (Ligue 2; 1-2) and won in Nantes (0-2) in Ligue 1. The club based at the Stade Francis-Le Blé has settled into the upper half of the standings in recent weeks. At home in the Championship, however, they are coming off a heavy defeat against PSG (2-5), then on February 
Almost three months have passed since Auxerre's last victory, which has just gone 9 games without taking the 3 points. AJA is weighed down by its 4 defeats in a row away from home and at the same time shows a certain solidity at home, illustrated by its 5 successive points shared at the Abbé-Deschamps including Sunday against Toulouse (2-2). Before taking a point against TFC, the club from Yonne had just held Saint-Etienne (1-1) and sunk in Monaco (4-2). This poor form is not so costly in the standings for Auxerre, who were coming off a very good run before going on a bad run. Thus, they are only 11th, with a 6-point lead over the virtual play-off team. Advantage Brest on form

The workforce for Brest Auxerre
Brest is playing a new match without the long-term absentee Locko, the experienced full-back Amavi, injured, and the substitute midfielder Martin, who has just returned to training. Del Castillo (5 goals in Ligue 1), out for the last 2 matches, is for his part in doubt. Still a scorer in Nantes, Ajorque leads his team in the offensive sector. The robust striker has made the net tremble in the last 5 Ligue 1 matches, a season in which he now has 9 goals. The Cardinal, a regular in defense before being injured for several weeks, has made his return but has sat on the bench without coming into play in the last 2 matches in the Championship. The club has not lost any players this winter and has strengthened with Bourgault on the left side of the defense. 

The Auxerre squad still cannot count on Coulibaly (1 goal) and the young Buayi-Kiala (no matches), who have already been on the sidelines for several months. Also absent is the senior defender Diomandé, who is also injured, while the senior Owusu (midfielder) and Hoever (right piston), who were injured last weekend, should be available. Still on the right side, Joly, suspended, will not be able to help out. Traoré has just scored his 9th goal in Ligue 1 against Toulouse. Among the winter recruits, Massengo is already a starter in midfield and Oppegard (left back) was content with coming on. The substitutes Pellenard and Raveloson have set sail.  Advantage Brest on paper
